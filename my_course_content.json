The assignment has three components: the written teaching case, a teaching note, and an in-class presentation. The teaching case should be no less than five pages and should provide a detailed exploration of a cybersecurity issue relevant to the concepts discussed in this course. The accompanying teaching note should offer guidance on how to effectively teach the case in a classroom setting. Finally, you will present your case to the class in a 15-minute presentation, which will form part of your overall grade. \n\nComponent 1: Written Teaching Case (min. 5 pages) \nYour teaching case should present a real-world scenario or hypothetical situation that illustrates a cybersecurity challenge. The case should be well-researched, providing a comprehensive overview of the issue, the key players involved, and the decisions that need to be made. It should be engaging and thought-provoking, encouraging students to apply their knowledge of cybersecurity principles, network security, threat analysis, or incident response. The case can be based on real events or can be fictional.  \n\nComponent 2: Teaching Note (min. 2 pages) \nThe teaching note is a crucial part of the assignment that helps instructors facilitate discussion and learning from the case. It should provide an overview of the case, key learning objectives, discussion questions, and potential answers or directions for the discussion. The teaching note should also suggest ways to integrate the case into the broader context of the course and how it aligns with the specific learning objectives. \n\nComponent 3: In-Class Presentation \nYou will present your teaching case to the class in a 15-minute presentation at an assigned time. This presentation is designed to simulate the process of teaching the case and leading a classroom discussion. You should summarize the key points of your case, introduce the discussion questions, and guide your peers through the decision-making process presented in the case. The presentation will be evaluated based on clarity, engagement, and the effectiveness of your teaching strategy.\n"

      "content": "Lecture: How can I use Canvas to enhance my course design?\n\nAs an educator, you are both a curator and creator of course content. Following common universal design practices will help ensure that your students can access this content regardless of their abilities, and foster a positive learning environment for all. Modules can be a great way to organize assignments, quizzes, and pages with media for your students. In the sections below, you can find tips for presenting assignments, documents, and other media clearly. \nStep 1: Consider structure\nThe first step is to decide how you want to organize your course content for students. Is there a structure that is familiar to your students, whether it be from your department, school, or field of study? Some examples of structure include:\n\nWeeks or classes\nTopics or units\nChapters in a book\n\nConsider what system would make it easiest for you and your students to navigate course content.\nStep 2: Get good content\nThe second step in course development is often curating content. This could involve gathering or creating materials, such as:\n\nArticles\nDocuments\nTextbooks\nWebsite links\n Images, videos, and other media\n\nWhen finding and creating content, we recommend checking that it is accessible to all students, regardless of their strengths and abilities. For more information, see What does it mean to make content accessible?\nTip: Contact subject librarians, instructional designers, and the Student Disability Access Center for help.\nStep 3: Create assessment opportunities\nDetermine how you want to assess your students, providing multiple ways of checking student understanding. \n\nFormative assessments: Low-stakes activities that give students a chance to demonstrate their understanding while giving both students and instructors the opportunity to identify learning gaps. For more information, see the A&S Learning Design & Technology team's Formative Assessments overview. Tools you could use for formative assessments include:\n\nAssignments\nExternal tools, such as VoiceThread, Annotations (Hypothesis), or Kaltura Video Quizzes\nDiscussions\nQuizzes\n\nSummative assessments: Higher-stakes activities that evaluate a student's proficiency after the completion of an instructional unit. For more information, see the A&S Learning Design & Technology team's Summative Assessments overview.  Tools you could use for summative assessments include:\n\nQuizzes\nAssignments\nExternal tools, such as Gradescope or Peer Review\n\nStep 4: Build modules\nUsing the structure from step 1 above, create modules in your Canvas course and add your content to pages in the modules.\n\nCreate a module.\nAdd a page to the module.\nUse headings to structure the page and present concepts in small \"bite-sized\" pieces.\nGuide your students with clear and concise instructions.\nMake navigation as simple as possible by adding links to activities (e.g., assignments, discussions, quizzes) on the page. Create accessible links with uniquely descriptive link text. Examples of meaningful link text:\n\n\"Submit Week 3 Essay\" - link to an assignment.\n\"Intro to Accessibility (PDF)\" - link to an article\n \"Access the Oxford English Dictionary online\" - link to a website\n\nProvide context around embedded content. For example, if you embed a lecture video, provide a brief description of the content so that students will know what to expect when they watch it. For images, add meaningful text descriptions."
