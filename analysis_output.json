          "question": "When the cloud storage provider itself has been publicly compromised, what specific containment actions can our organization take, given we don't directly control their infrastructure?",
          "answer": "Your organization's containment strategy should prioritize immediately revoking all internal access to the compromised service and isolating any data copied back to your systems. Concurrently, secure any remaining sensitive data by migrating it to an uncompromised internal or alternative cloud environment while informing affected users to reset any potentially reused passwords."

          "question": "When discussing containment, should we only focus on technical steps, or should it also include communication and legal aspects?",
          "answer": "Your containment strategy should encompass both technical measures to stop the breach and essential non-technical steps like initial communication, legal considerations, and immediate stakeholder notification to holistically manage the incident."

          "question": "Does our response strategy need to address public communication, or should it focus solely on the technical containment of the social media account?",
          "answer": "Your response strategy should address both technical containment and the public communication aspect of the incident. Given the attacker is actively sending public notifications, managing public perception and misinformation is a critical part of containing the incident's overall impact."

          "question": "Since there's no patch available for the zero-day vulnerability for a week, what kind of containment actions should we propose for the immediate response?",
          "answer": "Your containment strategy should focus on immediate actions to limit further compromise and isolate affected systems, even without a patch. Consider network segmentation, host isolation, or temporarily restricting access to affected services or applications."
