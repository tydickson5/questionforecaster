          "question": "What are the fundamental characteristics of how wireless networks operate?",
          "answer": "Wireless networks primarily rely on radio waves to transmit data across devices and locations, differentiating them from wired networks that use physical cables. Due to this over-the-air transmission, security is paramount, necessitating the use of authentication protocols. These protocols verify the identity of devices and users attempting to access the network, ensuring that only authorized entities can connect and exchange data."
